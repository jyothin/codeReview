/*
 * Stacks
 * Stacks are a favourite of Computer Science classes, and yet in the real world are often overlooked – in Java, maybe 
 * this is because Stack is an extension of Vector and therefore somewhat old-fashioned.
 * Stacks support LIFO, and should ideally be used with push/pop operations, it’s not really for iterating over.
 * The class you want for a stack implementation in Java (since version 1.6) is Deque. This can act as both a queue 
 * and a stack, so reviewers should check that deques are used in a consistent fashion in the code.
